# Calculator Application

## Overview
This is a simple calculator application developed using JavaFX and FXML. The application provides basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- Decimal point support
- Clear (AC) and delete (backspace) functionality
- Immediate evaluation of expressions
- User-friendly graphical interface

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- JavaFX SDK
- NetBeans or any compatible Java IDE

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project in NetBeans (or another preferred IDE).
3. Ensure JavaFX libraries are configured.
4. Run the `Main.java` file.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Use the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
3. Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for calculations.
4. Press `=` to evaluate the expression.
5. Use `AC` to clear all input or `Delete` to remove the last character.
6. Results are displayed in the text field.

## Known Issues
- The application does not currently support complex mathematical functions like exponentiation or square roots.
- Division by zero displays an error message.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for parentheses and operator precedence.
- Implement a more advanced mathematical engine.
- Improve UI design and responsiveness.
